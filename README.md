# Financial_dataset-analysis
There has been slow growth in economic and human development sector. One of the main reasons for this is the lack of access of banks among African countries. Traditionally, access to bank accounts has been regarded as an indicator of financial inclusion.Despite the proliferation of mobile money in Africa and the growth of innovative fintech solutions, banks still play a pivotal role in facilitating access to financial services. Access to bank accounts enables households to save and facilitate payments while also helping businesses build up their credit-worthiness and improve their access to other financial services. Therefore, access to bank accounts is an essential contributor to long-term economic growth.

This is my financial data analysis. Its an analysis for this financial dataset including 4 african countries i.e Kenya,Tanzania,Rwanda and Uganda.

It provides a prediction of how many people use have bank accounts and the different factors that affect  the usage of bank accounts
It also provides the different conclusions and recommendations that I came up with i.e

1. The leading county in our analysis which is Rwanda also had the highest number of people with no bank accounts.

2. We can also be able to see that all the countries had high no of people with no bank accounts compared to those with bank accounts.

3. We can also see that the people who reached their education at primary levels and those with no education at all are also leading with no bank accounts.

The reccommendations I came up with are;

1. Banks should offer more education to people in oyrder for them to be able to know the banks exixst and the priveleges of having bank accounts.

2. Banks in Rwanda should find ways to make their citizens aware of what banks are and the imoportance of having bank accounts.
